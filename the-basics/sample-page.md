**Power BI Desktop** supports the use of **inline hierarchy labels**, which is the first of two features intended to enhance hierarchical drilling. The second feature, which is currently in development, is the ability to use nested hierarchy labels (stay tuned for that - our updates happen frequently).

### How inline hierarchy labels work

With inline hierarchy labels, you can see hierarchy labels as you expand visuals using the **Expand All** feature. One great benefit to seeing these hierarchy labels is that you can also choose to **sort** by these different hierarchy labels as you expand your hierarchical data.

#### Using the built-in Expand feature (without sorting by hierarchy labels)

Before we see inline hierarchy labels in action, let's review the default **Expand to next level** feature behavior. Doing so will help us understand (and appreciate) how useful inline hierarchy labels can be.

The following image shows a bar chart visual for annual sales. When you right-click on a bar, you can choose **Expand to next level**.
